# Football-Game-Prection-Using-Machine-Learning
This system basically football game prediction system using machine learning models
The machine learning model will predict the winning probabilty
Developed Logistic Regression, Support vector machine, Xgboost, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier.
Train and test the model accuracy
Before create the model do some feature selection using chi-2 method
By doing feature selection easier for to select the feature, which feature is more affecting during model prediction.
Finally doing hyperparameter tuning to increase the model accuracy
